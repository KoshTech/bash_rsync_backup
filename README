# Bash Rsync Backup

A lite Bash script to do backups for many host to many hosts, includind or not theirs databases.

## Features:

 * Unlimited hosts
 * Simple config files
 * Run from Cron or command line
 * Dump and compact MySQL databases
 
## How to use it:

 Change to /opt:
 $ cd /opt
 Clone the repos:
 $ git clone git://github.com/CidadelasIT/bash_rsync_backup.git
 
 

### Old version

 Copy rsyncbackup.sh to /usr/local/bin
 copy host1, host1_exclude and machines-enabled files to /etc/backup.d
 Edit host1 as you needed
 
## Adding more hosts:

 Make a copy of /etc/backup.d/host1 to /etc/backup.d/host2 and adjust all values.
 Add the host2 at end of /etc/backup.d/machines-enabled and save it.
 
## How it works?

 The script looks at /etc/backup.d/machines-enabled to retreive a list of hosts.
 The file /etc/backup.d/host1 contains the settings for backup of host1 machine.
 The file /etc/backup.d/host1_exclude contains a list of files that must be ignored in backup.
 For MySQL backups just put the login and data for root user in /etc/backup.d/host1. If mysql login credentials are present the backup will dump all databases.
